                   We plan to invite federal agencies’ program managers from multiple NSF programs including CISE-Smart and Connected Communities (SCC), CISE-Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), 
                   CMMI- Civil Infrastructure Systems (CIS), CMMI-Humans, Disasters, and the Built Environment (HDBE), and CBET-Environmental Sustainability, 
                   Sensors and Controls Program from DOE’s Building Technology Office, NIST Community Resilience Program, NFPA Applied Research Division, etc. 
                   We will reach out to program managers and invite them for their participation and plan the workshop program. We will leverage our research 
                   community connections for bringing the workshop to the attention of the researchers once the plan for program managers’ 
                   participation is finalized. Among these communities, we will leverage the research communities at ASCE such as Computing in Civil 
                   Engineering and Construction Research Congress as well as ACM BuildSys community. Moreover, 
                   we will send the workshop flyers to the university researchers (colleagues in our personal networks) across the US to leverage their network as well. </p>
