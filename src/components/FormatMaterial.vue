                   The workshop will be comprised of a single session with multiple themes, which includes presentations from invited papers, 
                   talks from program managers from federal agencies, flash talks of emerging ideas from young investigators, and panel discussions. 
                   The workshop will be held in Arlington, VA at the Virginia Tech research center. This venue has been considered to encourage the attendance 
                   of program managers from federal agencies such as National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), National Institute of Standards 
                   and Technology (NIST), Department of Transportation (DOT), and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) given the geographical proximity. 
                   We are planning for about 80 participants. The registration will be free and we are expecting the attendance of program managers from federal 
                   agencies will motivate other participants. We are also planning for a journal special collection, which will invite the submitted talks for a 
                   journal publication. The participants will submit a short submission up to 4 pages. A number of the submissions will be presented in the workshop 
                   sessions, and the rest (if any) will be invited as posters. We are planning to hold this workshop in mid-May 2019 once the spring semester is finished.
