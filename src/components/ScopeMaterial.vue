            We plan to organize a two-day workshop with a focus on building blocks of smarter cities. 
            The workshop is intended to bring researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and funding agenciesâ€™ managers to discuss the 
            state-of-the-art research, pioneering practices, and envisioned research and development directions. It will cover the research 
            themes at the intersection of technology, engineering, big data, and human science that will support infrastructure, mechanisms, 
            operations, and lives in smarter cities of the future. The research themes of interest in the workshop include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Smart buildings and building networks
                </li>
                <li>
                    Intelligent, sustainable, and resilient mobility
                </li>
                <li>
                    Community-aware city infrastructure
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smart and connected communities at the intersection of the above three themes
                </li>
                 </ul>
               
                
           
            </div>
